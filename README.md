# Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus - Source code

Source code from the companion CD of the book "Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus" (a detailed description can be found on the [Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Tricks_of_the_Game-Programming_Gurus)).

The CD-ROM (which can be found on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Tricks_of_the_Game_Programming_Gurus_SAMS_Publishing_1994)) actually contains a lot of other things, but the content strictly related to the book is just the source code (directory `SOURCE`).
